# Doctors Portal Server Side

The Doctors Portal Backend is a critical component of the Doctors Portal project, responsible for handling server-side logic, database interactions, authentication, and more.


## Technologies Used

* Node.js: The backend is built using Node.js, providing a scalable and efficient runtime for JavaScript.

* Express.js: Express.js is used to create a robust and flexible web application framework for routing and handling HTTP requests.

* MongoDB: MongoDB is the chosen database for storing data in a NoSQL format, providing flexibility and scalability.

* JSON Web Tokens (JWT): JWT is employed for secure user authentication and authorization.

* Nodemailer: Nodemailer is utilized for sending emails, a crucial feature for user notifications.

* Nodemailer-mailgun-transport: This transport module for Nodemailer enables email sending through the Mailgun service.

* Stripe: Stripe is integrated into the backend to handle payment processing securely.

* CORS: CORS middleware is used for enabling cross-origin requests, allowing frontend-backend communication.

* dotenv: The dotenv package helps manage environment variables for added security and flexibility.


## Getting Started

To run the backend server locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project's root directory.

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

### `npm install`

4. Configure environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the project's root directory. Sample variables include:

PORT=3001
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
MAILGUN_API_KEY=your_mailgun_api_key
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=your_mailgun_domain

Replace `your_mongodb_uri`, `your_jwt_secret`, `your_stripe_secret_key`, `your_mailgun_api_key`, and `your_mailgun_domain` with your actual credentials.

5. Start the server:

### `npm start`

6. The server will run at the specified port (default is 3001).
